# How To Use Active Breakpoint

The active breakpoint value can be determined by using the [ActiveBreakpointContext](/application/cerner-terra-application-docs/contexts/active-breakpoint-context). Components that use the ActiveBreakpointContext will be updated whenever the active breakpoint value changes.

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ActiveBreakpointContext } from '@cerner/terra-application/lib/breakpoints';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const activeBreakpoint = useContext(ActiveBreakpointContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This component retrieves and renders the active breakpoint</p>
      <p>{activeBreakpoint}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

> Note: An ActiveBreakpointContext value is provided by [ApplicationBase](/application/cerner-terra-application-docs/components/application-base). The rendering of additional ActiveBreakpointContext providers should be unnecessary is most cases.
