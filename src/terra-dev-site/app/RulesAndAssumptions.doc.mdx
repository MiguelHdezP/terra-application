# Rules

## Modals

* Modals that render a Page will nullify all relevant Page-related contexts (PageActionsContext, others?) to ensure presentation within the Modal is scoped.
  * If usage of those contexts is necessary, the Providers should be rendered within the renderPage prop, not around the Modal itself.
* Programatic navigation cannot be performed from within Modal.

## Pages

* withPageErrorBoundary must be used to wrap Page implementations with error safety to protect disclosure
* default error boundary is present within Page, with onError callback present to handle custom handling


## Navigation

* Modals/notification dialogs must be dismissed prior to programatic navigation

## ApplicationContainer

* Usage of the ApplicationContainer assumes parent-fill (100% height) is expected. Block layout of ApplicationContainer is not supported.
  * Thus, the ApplicationContainer's immediate parent element must have an explicit height value.
* One (1) ApplicationContainer can be rendered to the DOM at any given time.

## Layouts

* Should not be rendered within Modals

# Deprecations

* SlidePanelManager
* ModalManager
* DisclosureManager
